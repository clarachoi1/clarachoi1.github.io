          <h2>Course Description</h2>
          <p>
            Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction from the 1980s and 90s that explores themes of technological advancement and societal destruction.
            As author Bruce Sterling writes, “For the cyberpunks, ... technology is visceral. It is ... pervasive, utterly intimate. Not outside us,
            but next to us. Under our skin; often, inside our minds.” Students view iconic 1982 film Blade Runner with score performed live at Dolby Theatre.
            Students also tour Academy Museum of Motion Pictures exhibition Cyberpunk: Envisioning Possible Futures Through Cinema, and examine connections
            and disruptions between cyberpunk, futurisms, and contemporary technology. Students produce digital materials on class themes, building practical
            and analytical skills as part of their own contribution to cyberpunk legacies. Class meets January 7, February 18 from 3:30 to 5:45 p.m.,
            March 4 from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. Off-campus meetings take place January 21 from 7:30 to 10:30 p.m., February 4 from 1:30 to 5:00 p.m.
            Admission to offsite events included at no charge.

            automation, and artificial intelligence. Prof Noopur Raval, UCLA Information Studies, received her Ph.D. in Informatics from UC Irvine
            and researches histories of technology, digital infrastructures, and hi- and low-tech workers and AI in education, creative fields, and platform work.
